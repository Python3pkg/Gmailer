# What is Gmailer:

   Gmailer simplifies the dispatch of standard html email reports that includes tabular data, from any Gmail account.

## Setting up:

####Set up your gmail account to allow less secure apps
- To allow Gmailer to send emails from Gmail.
  - (Link to setup)[https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps]
  - If you turned on two-factor authentication, create an app and generate a one-time password specific for the app.  

####Set up environment variables for Gmail account and password (Recommended)
   *You can skip this step if you prefer to explicitly input your username and password*
   
   In terminal, type:
```bash
    export GMAIL_USER=myusername@gmail.com
    export GMAIL_PWD=mysecretpassword
```

   It is recommended to set the env vars to be persistent across each terminal session. You can do that by inserting the export commands above in .profile file in your root directory.

## How to use the module

####Create a python script in the same directory as 'Gmailer' (and this README.md)
Define the following in your script
`from mailer_module.postman import Gmailer`  
If you have set the env vars, then also include:
```python
    import os
    username = os.environ["GMAIL_USER"]
    password = os.environ["GMAIL_PWD"]
```

```
Call the send_mail method
```python
    Mailer.send_mail()
```

##Full Example
```python
    # Initialize Gmailer
    my_gmailer = Gmailer(
      # your gmail login credentials
      {
        "username":"my_username@gmail.com",
        "password":"my_password"
      },
      # Recipients
      ["user1@gmail.com","user2@gmail.com"],
      # Message Parameters
      {
        "from_name":"John"
        "subject":"A table of my family members",
        "header":"My Family"
      },
      # Table dictionary
      {
        # Table parameters
        "table_title":"Family Members",
        "table_link":"http://www.myfamily.com",
        "generate_sn":False,
        "generate_summary": "gender",
        "table":
          # 2-D table array with headers as first list element
          [
            ["s/n","Name","Gender","Age"],
            [1,"John","M","23"],
            [2,"Lucy","F","13"],
            [3,"Jack","M","64"]
          ]
        }
      )
    # Call send_mail() method
    my_gmailer.send_mail()
```

Gmailer will output the following in the email:
```
    From:    John "my_username@gmail.com"
    To:      user1@gmail.com; user2@gmail.com;
    Subject: A table of my family members
```
```
    ------------------------------
              MY FAMILY
    ------------------------------
    FAMILY MEMBERS
    Total: 3  | M: 2 | F: 1 |

    s/n    Name    Gender   Age
     1     John      M      23
     2     Lucy      F      13
     3     Jack      M      64

    Link <http://www.myfamily.com>
```
To see the package in action, set your gmail credential as env vars and execute: `example.py`

##Templates and styling
- Email templates should be named "email.html" and kept within the following directory: `mailer_module/html_generator/template`
- Email templates must be tagged with 2 placeholders: 
  - These placeholders will be replaced with the html generated by the package
  - In the header of the email template, insert:
```
    *<-- EMAIL HEADER HERE -->*
```
  - In the body of the email template, include:
```
    *<-- TABLES HERE -->*
```
- CSS Styling can be applied within the template header:
  - All tables generated are automatically classed as: `class=table_wrapper`
  - All table titles generated are automatically classed as: `class=title_wrapper`
- Note that some email clients do not load CSS table styling within the template headers.
    - As of last test, Gmail browser client does not load the CSS styling, but it works perfect on Apple iphone mail
    - TO_DO : apply css styling inline
